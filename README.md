# This repository contains all the task files of the 1-month virtual internship under Bharat Intern<br>

## Task-1 Details:<br>
<br>

**Project outline**: To build a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression.<br>
<br>

**Project Details**: Downloaded the Advanced House Prices Regression Dataset from Kaggle, <br>
                    Performed Exploratory Data analysis to figure out the relation between various features<br>
                    Handled Missing values, Scaled the values from high variance to low variance, and encoded the categorical columns<br>
                    Trained a RidgeRegression model, which outperformed simple LinearRegression model
                    <br>

## Task-2 details:<br>


**Project Outline**: To predict the quality of red wine using Linear Regression.<br>

**Project Details:** 1. Dowloaded the Red Wine Quality Dataset from Kaggle.<br>
                     2. Automated the Exploratory Data Analysis by using ydata_profiling library, to create an interactive notebook frame<br>
                     3. Scaled the data appropriately to fit for the LinearRegression model<br>
                     4. Trained a simple Linear Regression model, with only a mean squared error of 0.65 on Training Set and 0.62 on the validation set
